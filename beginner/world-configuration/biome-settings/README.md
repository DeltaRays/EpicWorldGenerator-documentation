# Biome settings

Each world has it is own set of settings that apply to individual biomes. This contains general settings like ore configuration, biome terrain modifiers, custom structures and much more.

{% hint style="info" %}
> For a guide on editing custom structures, click [here](https://docs.dynamic-bytes.com/intermediate/create-structure). We will not go over custom structure and tree settings here.
{% endhint %}

#### Settings

At first the biome settings look overwhelming. This is just one of the biomes.

Next to each of the biomes is a comment line, with information about that setting. If there is an exclamation mark `!` in the comment, it will contain a number as well. This corresponds to a list of additional information at the bottom.

{% hint style="warning" %}
> Note that you **can not** copy paste this file into your own, since comments are not supported in the used file format.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
> Also note that these settings only apply to **this** biome.
