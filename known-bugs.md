{% hint style="info" %}
> At the right, you can find if the bug applies to a version. If a `?` is specified, it is unkown if it applies to that version. `Yes` indicates that the bug does and `no` indicates that the bug doesn't apply to that version.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
> If you want to use any version in this list because it has acceptable bugs / the least amount of bugs, and it is not the same version as your server, you can follow this guide: [How to migrate a world](https://docs.dynamic-bytes.com/beginner/how-to-migrate-a-world)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
> The `Workaround?` column indicates if there is a possible workaround \(however much time it may take\). Contact support on our Discord if you need help with this. Please do not ask for a workaround if there is a `No`in that column.
