# Known bugs

{% hint style="success" %}
> We currently recommend using 1.15.2 on PaperMC \(latest 1.15.2 stable\).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
> At the right, you can find if the bug applies to a version. If a `?` is specified, it is unkown if it applies to that version. `Yes` indicates that the bug does and `no` indicates that the bug doesn't apply to that version.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
> If you want to use any version in this list because it has acceptable bugs / the least amount of bugs, and it is not the same version as your server, you can follow this guide: [How to migrate a world](https://docs.dynamic-bytes.com/beginner/how-to-migrate-a-world)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
> The `Workaround?` column indicates if there is a possible workaround \(however much time it may take\). If there is no reference to a pointer at the bottom, please contact support on our [Discord ](https://discord.gg/Jq3ecb3)for help with this. Please do not ask for a workaround if there is a `No`in that column, you won't get one.

| Doesn't contain broken portals | No | Yes | Yes | Yes \( 1. \)  |
| World gen doesn't stop at border | Yes | ??? | Yes | No |

1. Making [custom structures](https://docs.dynamic-bytes.com/intermediate/create-structure) out of the portals and having them spawn, just like any other custom.
