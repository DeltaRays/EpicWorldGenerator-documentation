## This plugin works with Paper Spigot 1.15.2!

{% hint style="danger" %}
> This plugin does **NOT** work with Paper 1.16.1. We are awaiting an update.  
> For the time being, you can either use Spigot 1.16.1, or [pre-generate](https://docs.dynamic-bytes.com/beginner/pre-generation) a world on 1.15.2, and put that in your 1.16.1 server \(after uninstalling EWG\).
{% endhint %}
